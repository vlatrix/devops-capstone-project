As a DevOps engineer  
I need to automatically build Docker images on code changes
So that I can deploy updates frequently and efficiently

- The app code is in a GitHub repository
- Dockerfile is in the repo to build an image
- Using GitHub Actions workflows

Given the app code is in a GitHub repo with a Dockerfile
When code is pushed to the main branch  
Then a GitHub action builds a new Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub
